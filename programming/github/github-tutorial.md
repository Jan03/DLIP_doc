# Tutorial: Github basic

## Terminology

**Repository:** 

A **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs

**Branch:**

The way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. By default your repository has one branch named `main` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `main`.

This diagram shows:

* The `main` branch
* A new branch called `feature` \(because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch\)
* The journey that `feature` takes before it’s merged into `main`

Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:

* `story.txt`
* `story-joe-edit.txt`
* `story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt`

Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.

**Commit:**

It tells Git that you made some changes which you want to record.

**Pull:**

When you open a _pull request_, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch

## The GitHub flow

The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around core Git commands used by teams around the globe—including ours.

The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented:

1. **Create a branch:** Topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch \(usually `main`\) allow teams to contribute to many parallel efforts. Short-lived topic branches, in particular, keep teams focused and results in quick ships.
2. **Add commits:** Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the project’s history.
3. **Open a pull request:** Pull requests publicize a project’s ongoing efforts and set the tone for a transparent development process.
4. **Discuss and review code:** Teams participate in code reviews by commenting, testing, and reviewing open pull requests. Code review is at the core of an open and participatory culture.
5. **Merge:** Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.
6. **Deploy:** Teams can choose the best release cycles or incorporate continuous integration tools and operate with the assurance that code on the deployment branch has gone through a robust workflow.
