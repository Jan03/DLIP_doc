### What is Keras

 Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. _Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research._
