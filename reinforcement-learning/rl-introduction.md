# RL Introduction

## Overview of Reinforcement Learning

RL is teaching BY experience. A good strategy for an agent would be to always choose an action that maximizes the \(discounted\) future reward

### Environment and Actions

Challenge in RL in real-world applications are how to provide the experience? One option is providing Realistic simulation + transfer learning

### Optimal Policy

Both Environment model and Reward structures have big impact on optimal policy
