# Python

## Create the new environment:

* To create the new environment for Python 3.6, in your terminal window or an Anaconda Prompt, run: \(example: env name 'py3'\)

  ```text
  conda create -n py36 python=3.6 anaconda
  ```

## [Updating or upgrading Python](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-python.html#id4)

Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps.

If you are in an environment with Python version 3.4.2, the following command updates Python to the latest version in the 3.4 branch:

```text
conda update python
```

The following command upgrades Python to another branch---3.6---by installing that version of Python:

```text
conda install python=3.6
```
