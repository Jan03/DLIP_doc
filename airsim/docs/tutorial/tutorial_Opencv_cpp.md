## Controlling Vehicle with OpenCV C++

 You can drive the car using keyboard, gamepad or [steering wheel](steering_wheel_installation.md). To fly drone manually, you will need either XBox controller or a remote control (feel free to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) keyboard support). Please see [remote control setup](remote_control.md) for more details.

You can use [APIs](apis.md) for programmatic control or use so-called [Computer Vision mode](image_apis.md) to move around in environment using the keyboard.
