# Jupyter Notebook

### What is  Jupyter Notebook

This section focuses on IPython and Jupyter notebook and how they interact. When we discuss `IPython`, we talk about two fundamental roles:

* Terminal IPython as the familiar REPL
* The IPython kernel that provides computation and communication with the frontend interfaces, like the notebook

Jupyter Notebook and its flexible interface extends the notebook beyond code to visualization, multimedia, collaboration, and more.
